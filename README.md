# Network-Broadcast-on-a-time-varying-ad-hoc-network

The project analyzes an ***ad-hoc*** network running during a four to five day conference setting.

**Assumptions:** 
1. Exchange of data is ***bidirectional*** upon any sighting in the trace.
2. Whenever nodes sight each other, the sighting is long enough for complete transfer of data in both directions.
3. In part 1, each node transmits to the first K ***unique neighbours*** it sights.
4. The transmission probability space is such that ***x%+y% = 100%***
